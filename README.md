I let my Desktop space get too cluttered with all my downloads and screenshots, so I made this easy tool to help organize my files, images, pdfs, whatever in their own folders. It really helps me out.

To run it, `cargo run -- -d <PATH TO DIRECTORY>` and your directory will be organized.

So far, it separates images, pdfs, videos, audio clips.
